# Task Completion Checklist

## Code Quality Checks (Always Required)
When completing any coding task, always run these commands:

### 1. Linting and Formatting
```bash
ruff check .              # Check for linting issues
ruff format .             # Format code according to project style
ruff check --fix .        # Auto-fix any fixable linting issues
```

### 2. Type Checking
```bash
mypy src/                 # Type check source code
```

### 3. Testing
```bash
pytest                    # Run all tests
pytest --cov=src/         # Run tests with coverage
```
